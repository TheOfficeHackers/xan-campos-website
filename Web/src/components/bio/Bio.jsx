      <div>Xan Campos, composer and jazz pianist </div>
      <section> Xan Campos (Galicia, 1987) grew as a pianist and composer at conservatories in Galicia, Basque Country, Copenhagen, Amsterdam and Berlin, stages that allowed him to be in contact with the European jazz vanguard, playing at venues and festivals of a large part of the continent.
      
      Currently, Xan Campos is one of the most active pianists in the Iberian Peninsula, both leading his own projects and as a sideman of prominent artists from the Spanish and Portuguese jazz scenes. Still in his early thirties, he has a specially extensive career, having recorded 5 albums in his own name and more than 20 as an accompanist with big names of this musical genre.
      
      He also enjoys relevance in Latin America, where he has played at festivals in Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, Ecuador and Colombia, as well as performing at several venues in New York City (USA).
